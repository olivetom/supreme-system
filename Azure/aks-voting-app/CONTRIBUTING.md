When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

Help us keep this project open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the GitHub Repository. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Small features can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue
Before you submit an issue, search the archive to ensure that your question was not already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a [new issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-voting-app/issues/new).
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Provide as much detail as possible in the issue.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

- Search the repository for an [open or closed PR](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-voting-app/pulls)
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
- Make your changes in a new git fork:
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- Push your fork to GitHub:
- In GitHub, create a pull request
- If we suggest changes then:
  - Make the required updates.
  - Rebase your fork and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):
    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
